# Ṛta (ऋत)

Ṛta (ऋत) is a minimal metadata store for durable system state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The type `T` must use `repr(C)`, and should not implement `Drop` trait to avoid undefined behaviour (ub).

> [!TIP]
> Ṛta (ऋत) is a _Vedic_ concept of cosmic order, truth, and invariance, which inspires the design of Ṛta.
